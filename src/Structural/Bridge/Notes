Bridge allows abstractions to vary independently.

Something drawable may have a shape, a color, texture, an opacity... but not all
of these things need be drawn using the same class. Some functionality
can be removed from say an abstract class Drawable, put in it's own abstract class
and have that separated functionality and it's implementations be allowed to change and extend
as much as desired without refactoring the Drawable.
