In such cases where you'll use a class several times, then removing it from the graph
(by making it Creational.Singleton) is preferable to DI.

-Logger
-Calendar

Also:
Domain singletons
" if you have an Organization entity and there can be only one such entity in your
domain model, itâ€™s just fine to represent it as a Creational.Singleton as well:"

How is that different from a Logger other than that Logger is a utility...
