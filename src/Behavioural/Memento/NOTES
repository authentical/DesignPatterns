Save an objects state so it can be restored later without violating encapsulation.
Special implementation so Originator object data "a Memento" is completely private,
saved state data becomes immutable. Often an inner class.



Examples:
Undo object state
Save game progress
UML shapes connect by line... rectangles movable but line stays connected. I don't get this one.
Checkpoints in undo operations
